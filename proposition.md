 ✅ **Family Obligations**: Can't ignore requests from home, but need to budget for it  
 ✅ **Sapa is Real**: Everyone experiences broke periods; the app helps you survive and plan better

### **Your Competition-Winning Pitch**

\*\*"Theora is the productivity and financial wellness app built for how young Nigerians actually live—juggling school or work, multiple side hustles, family obligations, and tight budgets.

We don't just help you organize tasks; we help you prioritize what makes money, what builds your future, and what keeps you sane. We don't just track expenses; we understand that data is essential, that aso-ebi contributions are non-negotiable, and that sometimes you need to know if you can afford to flex this weekend.

Because in Nigeria, you're not just managing your time—you're managing your hustle. And your money doesn't just need tracking—it needs strategy. Theora is the copilot every ambitious Nigerian student and young professional needs to survive today and build tomorrow."\*\*
