# Theora

This is a platform that empowers young people to manage their time and money wisely. It was built primarily using the Gemini Agent. 

`GEMINI.md` contains comprehensive documentation concerning the app's source code.

 The app uses Tailwind.CSS for styling and Rollup for module bundling.

## Backend
We primarily used Firebase as backend for database and authentication.
 We also used Amazon Bedrock as an AI provider.

## Running the app
Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
Run `npm run dev` to start an autoreloading development server.
Use `npm run build` to generate a build of the app in `site`.

 Note: if newer changes are not showing in the preview or in the build, hold `Shift` and press `Reload` or `Refresh` in your browser.


## Prerequisites
1. NodeJS must be installed to path.
2. NPM must be installed to path.
